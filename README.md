# AI_CHATBOT:
An AI chatbot built using basic Python libraries typically leverages natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users through text-based communication. A simple chatbot can be created using libraries such as nltk (Natural Language Toolkit), re (for regular expressions), and random for generating responses. The bot first processes the userâ€™s input by tokenizing the text, cleaning it (removing punctuation or unwanted characters), and then analyzing it using basic NLP techniques. A decision-making system, based on pattern matching or predefined keyword responses, can then be used to generate appropriate replies. Additionally, input() can be used for real-time interaction, allowing the bot to converse with users. The chatbot may not include sophisticated machine learning models but can perform basic tasks like responding to greetings, answering FAQs, or offering simple information based on keyword matching.
